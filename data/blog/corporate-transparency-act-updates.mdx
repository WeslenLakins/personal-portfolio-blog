# What is the Corporate Transparency Act?

Enacted as part of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, the CTA requires certain business entities to disclose their beneficial ownership information to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).[^1] Beneficial owners include individuals who directly or indirectly own or control at least 25% of a company or exercise substantial control over it.[^2] The CTA aims to increase transparency and prevent bad actors from using anonymous entities for illicit activities, such as money laundering and terrorism financing.[^3]

# Recent Legal Challenges: Conflicting Court Orders and the Current Status

The CTA’s reporting requirements, initially scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2024, faced significant legal challenges in late 2024. A federal judge in the Eastern District of Texas issued a preliminary injunction in _Texas Top Cop Shop, Inc. v. McHenry_ (formerly _Texas Top Cop Shop v. Garland_), blocking the enforcement of the law due to concerns over its constitutionality and its impact on small businesses.[^4]

On January 23, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the government’s motion to stay this injunction, which would have reinstated the CTA’s reporting requirements.[^5] However, a separate nationwide injunction issued in _Smith v. U.S. Department of the Treasury_ remains in effect, keeping the reporting requirements suspended despite the Supreme Court’s ruling in _Texas Top Cop Shop_.[^6]

As a result, reporting companies are not currently required to file beneficial ownership information with FinCEN and will not face liability for failing to file while the _Smith_ order is in place.[^7] However, businesses can voluntarily submit beneficial ownership reports to FinCEN if they choose to do so.[^8]

# Current Compliance Recommendations for Businesses

While the enforcement of the CTA’s reporting requirements is temporarily halted, businesses should still take proactive steps to prepare for future compliance, especially given the possibility that the _Smith_ order could be lifted or modified. Preparing now will allow businesses to avoid last-minute compliance issues if the legal landscape changes.

Conducting a beneficial ownership audit is an essential first step. Businesses should identify all individuals who qualify as beneficial owners under the CTA, including direct and indirect owners and those who exercise substantial control.[^9] Establishing internal procedures for collecting, verifying, and securely storing beneficial ownership information is also critical.[^10] These systems should be capable of quickly activating if reporting requirements resume.

Additionally, businesses should stay informed about court decisions and announcements from FinCEN, regularly checking for updates on the _Smith_ order’s status.[^11] Seeking legal guidance can ensure that businesses are well-prepared for compliance once the legal landscape stabilizes.[^12]

# Revisiting the Privacy Implications of BOI Reporting

The CTA’s requirement to disclose beneficial ownership information has raised significant privacy concerns, as highlighted in my previous article, [The Dangers of the Corporate Transparency Act & BOI Reporting Requirements](https://www.weslakins.com/blog/the-dangers-of-the-corporate-transparency-act-and-boi-reporting-requirements).[^13] While the CTA aims to enhance transparency, critics argue that the centralized collection of sensitive ownership information could expose businesses and their owners to privacy breaches and misuse of data.[^14]

To mitigate these risks, businesses should implement cybersecurity measures and limit access to beneficial ownership information within their organizations.[^15] Businesses should also consider encrypting sensitive data and ensuring that only authorized personnel have access.

# Key Implications for Tennessee Businesses

Tennessee, with its vibrant business community, is home to many small and mid-sized entities directly affected by the CTA once reporting requirements resume.[^16] Industries such as real estate, construction, and manufacturing—where ownership structures can be complex—may face challenges in accurately identifying and reporting beneficial owners.[^17] Preparing now can help mitigate delays and complications once the reporting mandate is reinstated.
