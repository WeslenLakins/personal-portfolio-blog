![AI, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning](/static/images/ai/ai-russian-dolls.png)

The ongoing discussion about artificial intelligence (AI) and its subsets, machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning, can be confusing.[^1] The terms are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same.[^2] What follows is an attempt to clear up the confusion by examining the similarities and differences between these concepts.[^3]

# AI, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning

Think of these concepts as a set of Russian dolls, with AI as the largest doll, and machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning as the smaller dolls nested within it.[^4] Each concept builds on the one before it, with AI being the most general and deep learning the most specific.[^5]

## AI

At the outermost layer you have AI, the biggest doll, which refers to any computer system's ability to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence.[^6] This includes tasks like recognizing speech, understanding natural language, and making decisions based on data.[^7] AI can be further divided into two categories: narrow AI and general AI.[^8] Narrow AI is designed to perform a specific task, like playing chess or recognizing faces, while general AI is designed to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.[^9] General AI is still largely theoretical and has not yet been achieved.[^10]

## Machine Learning

Inside AI, you have machine learning, where the computer is trained to recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns.[^11] Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on a specific type of task: learning from data.[^12] Machine learning can be further divided into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.[^13] Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning involves training a model to make decisions based on feedback from the environment.[^14] Each type of machine learning has its own strengths and weaknesses, and is suited to different types of tasks.[^15]

## Neural Networks

Nestled in machine learning, you have neural networks, which are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure of the human brain.[^16] Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes that process data and make predictions.[^17] Neural networks can be further divided into feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks.[^18] Feedforward neural networks are the simplest type of neural network, with data flowing in one direction from input to output.[^19] Recurrent neural networks are more complex, with data flowing in loops through the network, allowing the network to process sequences of data.[^20] Convolutional neural networks are designed to process images and other spatial data, with layers that learn to detect patterns in the data.[^21] Each type of neural network is suited to different types of tasks, and can be combined to create more complex models.[^22]

## Deep Learning

Inside neural networks, you have deep learning, which is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses multiple layers of interconnected nodes to process data and make predictions.[^23] Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on learning from data using multiple layers of interconnected nodes.[^24] Deep learning can be further divided into deep neural networks, deep belief networks, and deep reinforcement learning.[^25] Deep neural networks are the most common type of deep learning algorithm, with multiple layers of interconnected nodes that process data and make predictions.[^26] Deep belief networks are a type of deep learning algorithm that uses multiple layers of interconnected nodes to learn complex patterns in data.[^27] Deep reinforcement learning is a type of deep learning algorithm that uses multiple layers of interconnected nodes to learn how to make decisions based on feedback from the environment.[^28] Each type of deep learning algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and is suited to different types of tasks.[^29]

# Deep Learning v. Neural Networks

Deep learning is essentially a more advanced form of neural networks.[^30] To explain, if neural networks are the human brain, deep learning is the human brain on steroids.[^31] Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multiple layers of interconnected nodes to process data and make predictions.[^32] These layers of nodes are called hidden layers, and they allow the network to learn complex patterns in the data.[^33] The more layers a network has, the deeper it is, and the more complex patterns it can learn.[^34] This is why deep learning is able to achieve such impressive results in tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.[^35] These deep neural networks usually operate in a feedforward manner, with data flowing in one direction from input to output.[^36] However, they can also be designed to process sequences of data, like text or speech, using recurrent neural networks.[^37] Additionally, they can also learn and correct themselves through a process called backpropagation.[^38] This is where the network compares its predictions to the correct answers and adjusts its weights and biases to minimize the error.[^39] This process is repeated many times until the network learns to make accurate predictions.[^40]

Deep learning networks are more complex and efficient than traditional neural networks because they can learn from large amounts of data and automatically extract features from that data.[^41] This makes them well-suited to tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing, where the data is complex and high-dimensional.[^42] However, deep learning networks are also more computationally expensive and require more data to train than traditional neural networks.[^43] This is because they have more parameters to learn and more layers to process the data.[^44] Nevertheless, despite these challenges, deep learning has achieved impressive results in a wide range of tasks, and is considered one of the most promising areas of AI research.[^45]

# Neural Networks v. Machine Learning

Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure of the human brain.[^46] They are composed of layers of interconnected nodes that process data and make predictions.[^47] Neural networks are able to learn complex patterns in the data and make accurate predictions, which makes them well-suited to tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.[^48] However, neural networks are just one type of machine learning algorithm, and there are many other types of machine learning algorithms that do not use neural networks.[^49] For example, decision trees, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors are all machine learning algorithms that do not use neural networks.[^50] Instead, these algorithms use different techniques to learn from data and make predictions.[^51] Decision trees, for example, use a tree-like structure to make decisions based on the data, while support vector machines use a hyperplane to separate the data into different classes.[^52]

Additionally, one big difference is how neural networks learn from data.[^53] Neural networks use a process called backpropagation to learn from data, where the network compares its predictions to the correct answers and adjusts its weights and biases to minimize the error.[^54] This process is repeated many times until the network learns to make accurate predictions.[^55] Other machine learning algorithms use different techniques to learn from data, like gradient descent, which adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the error.[^56] These techniques are simpler and more efficient than backpropagation, but they are also less powerful and less flexible.[^57]

# Machine Learning v. Artificial Intelligence

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on learning from data.[^58] Machine learning algorithms are able to recognize patterns in the data and make predictions based on those patterns.[^59] This makes them well-suited to tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.[^60] However, machine learning is just one type of artificial intelligence, and there are many other types of artificial intelligence that do not use machine learning.[^61] For example, expert systems, rule-based systems, and genetic algorithms are all types of artificial intelligence that do not use machine learning.[^62] Instead, these systems use different techniques to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence.[^63] Expert systems, for example, use a set of rules to make decisions based on the data, while genetic algorithms provide a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems based on natural selection by repeatedly modifying a population of individual solutions.[^64]

Also, machine learning is able to learn from data and make predictions, but it is not able to perform other tasks that would typically require human intelligence, like understanding natural language or making decisions based on context.[^65] This is because machine learning algorithms are designed to perform a specific type of task: learning from data.[^66] They are not able to perform tasks that require general intelligence, like reasoning, planning, and problem-solving.[^67] This is where other types of artificial intelligence, like expert systems and rule-based systems, come in.[^68] These systems are able to perform tasks that require general intelligence by using a set of rules or heuristics to make decisions based on the data.[^69] This makes them well-suited to tasks like diagnosing diseases, playing chess, and controlling robots.[^70]
