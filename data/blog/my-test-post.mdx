## Introduction

Ever wondered how much the government knows about your life? Picture this: your morning weather check,[^1] that fitness app tracking your runs,[^2] or even your favorite dating app[^3]â€”these seemingly mundane activities are treasure troves of data. Now, imagine if the government could buy this information without your consent or a warrant. Sounds like something out of a dystopian novel, right? Unfortunately, this has been our reality.[^4] But things are changing.[^5]

The world of data privacy has been buzzing with significant developments lately.[^6] While we always knew big brother was watching, a 2022 report to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI)[^7] revealed just how deep the rabbit hole goes, igniting a firestorm of public and legislative scrutiny.[^8] Now, with the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act having cleared the House and likely to pass the Senate,[^9] the IC has released a new "Commercially Available Information Framework"[^10] to navigate this evolving terrain. Turn on your VPNs, and let's unpack what this means for our privacy.
